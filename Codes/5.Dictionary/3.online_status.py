# Online status

# The aim of this challenge is, given a dictionary of people's online status, to count the number of people who are online.

# For example, consider the following dictionary:
"""
# statuses = {
#     "Alice": "online",
#     "Bob": "offline",
#     "Eve": "online",
# }
# In this case, the number of people online is 2.
"""


# Write a function named online_count that takes one parameter. The parameter is a dictionary that maps from strings of names to the string "online" or "offline", as seen above.

# Your function should return the number of people who are online.


def online_count(the_dict):
    """
    the_dict : dictionary
    number_of_people online: int
    """

    count = 0
    for i in the_dict.values():
        if i == "online":
            count += 1
    return count

print(online_count({
    "Alice": "online",
    "Bob": "offline",
    "Eve": "online",
