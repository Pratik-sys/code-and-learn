## Fibonacci Numbers

> The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.

`0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144`
- The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
- The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
- The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2)
- And the 5 is (2+3), and so on!


Fibonacci numbers is defined is recurrence relation,

`F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n- 2)`

 where,
- `x(n)` is term number "n"

- `x(n-1)` is the previous term (n-1)

- `x(n-2)` is the term before that (n-2)
